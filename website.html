            First I express my heartiest thanks and gratefulness to almighty God for his divine blessing makes me possible to complete the final project successfully. . Although quite short, for me this was a great experience I can learn from. It helped me to explore my skills and increased my interest in web development. I am really grateful and wish my profound indebtedness to Mr. Aman Kesarwani Sir . His infinite patience,scholarly guidance,continual encouragement, constant and energetic supervision, constructive criticism, valuable advice, readingmany inferior draft and correcting them at all stage have made it possible to complete this project documentation. Without this valuable support and guidance, this training could not elevate up to this level of development from my point of view. He supports me a lot and also supports my field of interest in backend development. He encourages me a lot and I am very grateful to him. The environment was excellent in this company and my colleagues of One Load make me happyevery time. Nobody has been more important to me in the pursuit of this project than the members of my family. I would like to thank my parents, whose love and guidance are with me in whatever I pursue. They are the ultimate role models.

            There are many reasons building a website requires that we obtain the right tools and resources.
            Standardization is one factor. When we use the right tools, we are assured that our pages would be standard and acceptable to every visitor.
            By using standard resources and tools, our visitors are able to view our web pages no matter what browser they use. Our pages would load faster and we would also be able to maintain the pages we have created with ease.
            Using the right resources for our web design jobs will make our websites contemporary. The standard tools used for creating the website will ensure that things such as navigation, menus and layout conform to current practices with which every web user is familiar with.
            Our pages become attractive if we use the right tools. They can display correctly in the browser and your visitors would be glad to visit again because you appealed to then.
            Web tools make your web design job easy. Coding can take away a lot of time and produce fatal errors if you are not proficient. 
            Speed of implementation comes with the right tools. You can create a website and launch it in an hour with the right resources. You save on time, effort and never miss important deadlines.
            Now that you are equipped with the right knowledge you can go about your web design with the assurance that you are going to produce something appealing and acceptable to most browsers.
